# Real Estate Hub

Real Estate Hub is a front-end project for a modern and responsive property listing website. It allows users to browse, search, and view details for various properties like houses, apartments, and land. This was my first project, focusing on building a clean user interface with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
